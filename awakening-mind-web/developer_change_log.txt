Changes Log:
1. Made a seperate "Featured Publications" section  (Name is subject to change if Prof.G has a better idea)
2. Remove the old Home Page design created by Tian many years ago. Rebuild the entire Recent Release section to make it more organized and visually aesthetic
3. Remove the ((1776 Now)) at the Top, instead, I recommend filling this part with a intro

Update 4/12/2021  - by Andy Hong

1. Added ((1776)) Now video series to the top right of main page(index.html)
2. Added ((A Perfect Union)) podcast as a new stripe row
3. In document, revome the DOWNLOAD section, added the Declaration of Interdependence and 7 stages, and made them directly open upon clicking
4. Clean up the document section link
5. Clean up the format on the main page to make the styles look nicer
 (Note to Ashok: As you probably that I cleaned up the style & format at the top of the main page of AwakeningMind a bit to make it look nicer. However I havent had time to do that for rest of the page yet.
 One thing I notice in the current page layout is that, and you can probably tell already, many elements in the page are kind of clustered together and don't look very clean. I think this is a defect 
 that Tian and Mark didnt had a chance to fix. A more clean and spaced-out and formatted page will make your website look much cleaner and professional, which will add to the credibility. So if you need 
 help/work on this regard, please let me know as this will also take some time work.
